# Google Assistant Enabler
This magisk module enables Google Assistant on phones running Nougat.

For smooth experience, enable OK Google Detection from any screen and train the voice model before installing the module. Install the module in magisk manager, but do not reboot. Manually reboot to recovery and wipe cache and dalvik/cache and then start the phone.
